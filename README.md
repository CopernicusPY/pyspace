# Pyspace
PySpace is an easy-to-use open-source NASA API Wrapper. Nasa developed a few apis to help the developers explore our world and even better, the space!

### What do we offer?

* [x] **Full coverage on the supported APIs:** Currently we do not support all the [NASA.gov](api.nasa.gov) APIs. Although on the ones we support, we provide **full** coverage.

* [x] **Extra-capable methods for result storing and visualization:** We provide methods that allow external result manipulation. (For example, our `earth_imagery()` method lets you save the image into a directory of your desire and even returns a NumPy Array of the pixel values that opens the way for advanced image annotation using third-party libraries such as OpenCV). As we are mentioning below this helps users create awesome projects.(**Visualization methods** are comming soon in `v.2.0.0 BETA`)
* [x] **Easy to read error handling:** afraid of facing errors? Not any-more! We took care of this by transforming the tracebacks and providing you straight to the point-answers!

* [x] **Easy to read outputs:** data returned from each request are really easy to read!

* [x] **Tons of possible usages:** The variety of methods we offer opens the way for users to combine our library and their imagination to create awesome projects!
* [x] **API-strict naming:** We follow strictly the naming style of each endpoint from the official [NASA.gov](api.nasa.gov) documentation. Therefore, no more confusion for our users on what method to use.
